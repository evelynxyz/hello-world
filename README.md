# hello-world
my first repository on GitHub! yay!

- 👋 Hi, I’m @evelynxyz
- 👀 I’m interested in education (because I am a elementary school teacher) and science, in particularly biology! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python and its related libraries like Numpy and Pandas on Codecademy!
- 💞️ I’m looking to exchange tips and collaborate with fellow Codecademy members who are on the Data Scientist path! As of 21st April, I am learning Numpy module!
- 📫 You can reach me by dropping a message via GitHub and I will get back to you soon!
